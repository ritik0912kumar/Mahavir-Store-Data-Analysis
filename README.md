# Mahavir-Store-Data-Analysis

Here's a detailed description of how I analyzed the Mahavir Store data using Excel tools such as Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Graphs. This description assumes you have a dataset of 30,000+ rows containing various sales and transaction information.

## Mahavir Store Data Analysis using Excel Tools

### Step 1: Importing Data
1. **Open Excel** and create a new workbook.
2. **Importing the data**:
   - Go to the `Data` tab.
   - Click on `Get External Data` (From Text, From Access, From Web, etc. based on your data source).
   - Locate and select your data file (e.g., CSV, Excel, etc.).
   - Follow the import wizard to load your data into Excel.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. **Ensure Data Quality**:
   - Checking for and remove duplicates.
   - Filling or correcting missing values.
   - Standardizing date formats and text entries.

2. **Convert Data Range to Table**:
   - Selecting the entire data range.
   - Go to the `Insert` tab and click on `Table`.
   - Ensuring "My table has headers" is checked and click OK.

### Step 3: Creating Pivot Tables
1. **Insert a Pivot Table**:
   - Click anywhere in your data table.
   - Go to the `Insert` tab and click on `PivotTable`.
   - Choose to place the Pivot Table in a new worksheet or existing worksheet.

2. **Design the Pivot Table**:
   - Drag and drop fields into the `Rows`, `Columns`, `Values`, and `Filters` areas to analyze your data.
   - For example, you can analyze total sales by month, product category, or sales representative.

### Step 4: Using Slicers for Interactive Filtering
1. **Add Slicers**:
   - Click on the Pivot Table.
   - Go to the `PivotTable Analyze` tab (or `Options` in older versions).
   - Click on `Insert Slicer` and select the fields you want to use as filters (e.g., Date, Product Category, Region).

2. **Use Slicers**:
   - Slicers will appear as buttons that allow you to filter the Pivot Table data interactively.
   - Click on the buttons to filter the data displayed in the Pivot Table.

### Step 5: Creating Graphs and Charts
1. **Insert Charts**:
   - Click anywhere in your Pivot Table.
   - Go to the `Insert` tab and choose the type of chart you want to create (e.g., Column Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart).
   - Excel will automatically create a chart based on your Pivot Table data.

2. **Customize Charts**:
   - Using the `Chart Tools` to format and customize your chart.
   - Adding chart titles, data labels, and legends to make your charts more informative.

### Step 6: Advanced Analysis
1. **Use PivotCharts**:
   - PivotCharts are linked directly to Pivot Tables and update automatically when the Pivot Table data changes.
   - Inserting a PivotChart by selecting the Pivot Table and choosing `PivotChart` from the `PivotTable Analyze` tab.

2. **Apply Conditional Formatting**:
   - Highlight important data points in your Pivot Table using Conditional Formatting.
   - Go to the `Home` tab, click on `Conditional Formatting`, and choose the rules you want to apply (e.g., color scales, data bars).

### Step 7: Creating Dashboards
1. **Combine Multiple Pivot Tables and Charts**:
   - Creating multiple Pivot Tables and Charts in different worksheets or the same worksheet.
   - Using Slicers to link and control multiple Pivot Tables simultaneously.

2. **Arrange the Dashboard**:
   - Placing Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers in a visually appealing and logical layout.
   - Ensuring that the dashboard is user-friendly and easy to understand.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can effectively analyze any types of raw data using Excel tools. Pivot Tables will help summarize and analyze large datasets, Slicers will provide interactive filtering options, and Graphs/Charts will visually represent the data trends and patterns. This analysis will enable better decision-making and provide valuable insights into the store's performance.
